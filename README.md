# Acknowledgements

In this assignment i used vaarious tools to get the results and verify my analysis. Once I had the code read and was not sure if the outcome is correct I would ask chatGpt to produce the outcome and verify. If i was not satisfied with the reslut then i contacted askBCS and my peers.
